# Eclecticism in Software

## 👨🏻‍💼 Education/Work 👨🏻‍💼
B.S. in computer science. Software engineer at a financial reporting company.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Technologies 👨🏻‍💻
I'm focused on Elixir, Kotlin, and TypeScript. I'm tremendously interested in the actor model, functional programming, and concurrency patterns. I specialize in messaging architectures, async/concurrent backends, and RPC. I'm also a hobby game developer (most recently using Haxe).

## 🧘🏻‍♂️ Lifestyle 🧘🏻‍♂️
I keep myself busy by doing things that give me experience, skills, or good stories to tell. I want to spend my life learning, meditating, and teaching.
