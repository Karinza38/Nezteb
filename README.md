# Eclecticism in Software

👨🏻‍💼 B.S. in computer science. Software engineer at a financial reporting company.

👨🏻‍💻 I'm focused on Elixir, Kotlin, and TypeScript. I'm tremendously interested in the actor model, functional programming, and concurrency patterns. I specialize in messaging architectures, async/concurrent backends, and RPC. I'm also a hobby game developer (most recently using Haxe).

🌎 I was born and raised in Alaska. I love Norway and speak Norwegian. ISTP. Enneagram 9. Neutral good. DFTBA.

🧘🏻‍♂️ I keep myself busy by doing things that give me experience, skills, or good stories to tell. I want to spend my life learning, meditating, and teaching.
